# ClawdBot Beginner Guide: Secure Deployment with Docker + OpenRouter

> This tutorial is based on minimum privilege and environment isolation principles to fully protect host security. Build a trustworthy personal AI assistant through Docker isolation, API configuration, platform integration, and scheduled tasks.

## Preface

ClawdBot is a powerful AI automation agent with capabilities to access systems, networks, and messages. **Installing directly on the host poses security risks** — if compromised, attackers could gain complete control.

This tutorial adopts a **triple protection strategy of Docker isolation + minimal privileges + external API management** to ensure that even if ClawdBot is breached, it won't compromise host security.

---

## Step 1: Docker Isolation Environment ✅

### Why Use Docker?

- **Permission Isolation**: ClawdBot cannot directly access host file system
- **Controllable Environment**: Independent Node.js environment, avoiding global dependency pollution
- **Quick Destruction**: Delete container with one command if issues arise, leaving no backdoors
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Linux/macOS/Windows all unified to Linux containers

### Install Docker (All Platforms)

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

#### macOS
1. Download Docker Desktop: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Install and start, ensure "Start Docker Desktop when you log in" is enabled
3. Log in

#### Windows
1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Log in

### Create Isolated Ubuntu Container

Windows and macOS users, please use Docker Desktop terminal:

![Docker Terminal](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/docker-terminal.png)

Click "Start new terminal", copy and execute the following commands to create and start the container:

macOS/Linux terminal users execute directly:
```bash
docker rm -f clawdbot 2>/dev/null || true
mkdir -p ~/clawdbot/data
docker run -d --name clawdbot \
  -p 18789:18789 \
  -p 18791:18791 \
  -v ~/clawdbot/data:/root/clawd \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ubuntu:22.04 tail -f /dev/null
docker exec -it clawdbot bash
```

Windows:
```powershell
docker rm -f clawdbot 2>$null
mkdir -Force ~/clawdbot/data
docker run -d --name clawdbot `
  -p 18789:18789 `
  -p 18791:18791 `
  -v ~/clawdbot/data:/root/clawd `
  --restart unless-stopped `
  ubuntu:22.04 tail -f /dev/null
docker exec -it clawdbot bash
```

> 📌 Tip: Point `/path/to/clawdbot/data` to a dedicated directory for persistent configuration and logs.

At this point, you've entered a clean Ubuntu container environment terminal, and you can see a command prompt `root@<container_id>:/#`.
Enter commands to execute operations within the container, completely isolated from the host system.

### Install Base Environment in Container

Copy and execute the following commands sequentially to install Node.js 22+ and Git, don't copy comment lines:
```bash
# Replace with Aliyun mirror (for 22.04 only, skip if outside China)
sed -i 's#http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu#http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu#g' /etc/apt/sources.list
sed -i 's#http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu#http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu#g' /etc/apt/sources.list

# Update package manager
apt update && apt install -y curl git wget sudo

# Install Node.js 22+
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify
node -v
git --version
```

After entering the commands sequentially, you'll see the version numbers of Node.js and Git, indicating successful installation.

---

## Step 2: One-Command ClawdBot Installation ✅

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

The installation script will automatically download ClawdBot.

![ClawdBot Installing](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/clawdbot-installing.png)

After downloading, enter the configuration directory:

The first question must be answered Yes!

![ClawdBot Installed](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/setting1.png)

For the second, choose quick start; for the third, choose openrouter
![ClawdBot Configuring](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/setting2.png)

Then it will ask you to fill in the API Key. Here you need to register an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) account, then click settings

![ClawdBot OpenRouter Key](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/setting3.png)

Select API Keys on the left side, then create a new Key. Leave options as default, copy the generated Key and paste it into ClawdBot's dialog box.

You can choose deepseek model, which is relatively much cheaper.

![ClawdBot OpenRouter Key Input](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/setting4.png)

This next step is very important, choose Telegram

Then go to Telegram and find @BotFather, send /newbot in the dialog, then enter a name and username (must end with _bot). It will give you a Token (the masked part at the end), copy and paste it into ClawdBot's dialog box.

![ClawdBot Telegram Bot Token Input](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/setting5.jpg)

Leave all remaining options as default, and ClawdBot installation and configuration is complete. But manually run the following command:

```bash
nohup clawdbot gateway --port 18789 --bind lan > gateway.log 2>&1 &
```

To persistently run ClawdBot's gateway service.

Then send a /start message to your Telegram Bot (search by the username you set) to see if you get a reply.

You should receive a pairing code, indicating ClawdBot is running successfully.
![ClawdBot Running](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/setting6.jpg)

In the terminal, enter the command:
```bash
clawdbot pairing approve telegram pairing_code
```

Approve the pairing code, and you can start using ClawdBot. Try sending messages in Telegram!

Next, enter:
```bash
clawdbot dashboard
```
It will print a link, open it in your browser, with an address like http://localhost:18789/?token=xxxxxx

Then after entering, it will show not yet paired.

Enter command:
```bash
clawdbot devices list
```

Under "pending", find the device ID waiting to be paired (the string in the first cell), then enter command:

![ClawdBot Approve Device](/images/blog/how-to-deploy-clawdbot-for-beginners/setting7.png)
```bash
clawdbot devices approve device_id
```

Then refresh the webpage, and you'll see pairing is successful. You can now manage ClawdBot and chat on the webpage.
