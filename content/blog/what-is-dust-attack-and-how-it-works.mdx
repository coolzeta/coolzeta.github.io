# What Is a Dust Attack and How It Works

Last week, I received a **weird** transaction in my wallet: someone sent me just **0.00001 USDC**. The gas fee alone was more expensive than the amount of USDC transferred.

Naturally, I wondered why anyone would bother sending such a tiny sum.

After checking the [transaction details](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xf338530ba8ba904d88a9a6a1c90cd8cdb7952bb79fd1e68d5b06ca9ad1a5d437) on the blockchain explorer, I discovered that the **“from” address** was funded by a wallet tagged as **“Phishing Scam”**.

I then did some research on similar cases online and concluded that this was likely a **dust attack**.

So what _is_ a dust attack?

## 1. What Is a Dust Attack

A **dust attack** (also called a dusting attack) consists of sending tiny amounts of cryptocurrency—known as **dust**—to a target wallet in order to **de-anonymize** its owner. The gathered information can then be used for **targeted phishing attacks**.

> _Source_: Common definition from blockchain security reports (e.g., Chainalysis, CipherTrace).

You might, like me, still be confused about the actual risk. After all, **all transactions are public on the blockchain**—why does a few satoshis or wei make any difference?

The answer lies in the **scale and complexity** of on-chain graphs. A single address can interact with thousands of others, forming a massive web. Manually identifying ownership clusters is time-consuming and often impractical. Dust provides a **low-effort hook** that can dramatically simplify the attacker’s analysis.

## 2. How It Works

### Bitcoin (UTXO model)

The technique originated on the **Bitcoin** chain, initially for legitimate AML purposes. Bitcoin encourages the use of a **fresh address** for each transaction. When you spend coins, any leftover change is sent to a **new change address** you control.

If an attacker sends dust to one of your addresses and you later **spend a transaction that includes that dust UTXO**, the dust will be combined with your other funds and sent to a **new address**. This reveals that the new address belongs to the same entity—greatly reducing the need for exhaustive graph analysis.

### Ethereum & L2s (account model)

On **account-based** chains like Ethereum and Arbitrum, dust works differently. Attackers cannot rely on UTXO merging, but they still exploit dust to:

1. **Bait interaction** with malicious contracts.
2. **Create address-poisoning** opportunities (see below).

Because L2 gas fees are low, attackers can dust **millions** of addresses cheaply, leading to many attack variants.

**Address Poisoning**

Once attackers confirm two addresses belong to the same user, they generate a **look-alike address** sharing the same prefix _and_ suffix.
Example:

- Real: `0x1234...6789`
- Fake: `0x1234...678A`

Wallets typically display only the first/last 4 characters (`0x1234…6789`). Users copying from history may paste the **fake** address and unintentionally send funds to the attacker.

**Fake Airdrop**

Attackers impersonate popular DeFi/NFT projects, announce a fake airdrop on social media, and direct victims to a phishing site. Users are asked to **sign an approval transaction with unlimited allowance** (which means attacker can operate your tokens as they want). They may receive worthless “airdrop” tokens first, lowering suspicion. Once enough approvals are collected, attackers drain the real assets.

## 3. How to Prevent It

- **Enable “Hide small balances”** (or equivalent) in your wallet settings.
- **Never move dust** to another address—leave it untouched.
- **Double-check website domains** and avoid suspicious links.
- **Never sign an approval transaction with unlimited amount**, even for seemingly legitimate projects.
- Use a **dedicated address** for high-value operations and keep dust-containing addresses isolated.
